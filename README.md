# TurtleGraphics-Maze
Its a Maze generator and Solver. (WIP)

Rules:
-You can startup the maze by launching mazeV030.py or opening it into a IDE.
-This is a Work in Progress that i created.
-All credits were credit is due is credited to me.
-Change anything you like.

Things to look out for:
-The algorithm i coded from the Backtrack Method.
-How the maze is draw and what the turtles are doing when a new choice is being made.

Improvments:
-When the width and height is to large the memory fills and breaks the game.
-Not very fast while being able to watch.
-Fixes on the solver.

Happy Coding!
